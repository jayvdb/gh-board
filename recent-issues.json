The old bears expect that currently.\n\nIs there a part of the codebase where we can make changes so that all the bears receive only the file contents and not the objects so that we don't have to change the bears implementation individually, you know like a middleware between the collection of objects and the actual analysis?\n\nYeah inside Processing.py. Instead of giving bears the file factory objects, give them file_factory.lines. I know we currently loose the lazy-loading capability with that, but that's easiest for now.\nIf you want to keep the lazy loading capabilities, we could write (like you suggested) some kind of \"middleware\", meaning we have a proxy dict object that gives access to file contents that works the same way as before for bears, but calls the right functions of FileFactory in the background.\nLike:\nclass FileDict:  # mimics dict\n    def __getitem__(self, filename):\n        return self._my_file_middlewares[filename]\n    #...\n\nclass FileMiddleware:\n    def __getitem__(self, lineindex):\n        return self._underlying_file_proxy.lines[lineindex]\n    #...","diffHunk":"@@ -13,6 +13,6 @@ def run(self, filename, file):\n         \"\"\"\n         yield Result.from_values(\n             origin=self,\n-            message='This file has {count} lines.'.format(count=len(file)),\n+            message='This file has {count} lines.'.format(count=len(file.lines)),","author":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4","name":"Mischa Krüger"},"createdAt":"2018-07-20T16:54:36Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-07-20T16:54:36Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwNDEyNTkyMw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5627#discussion_r204125923","bodyText":"fine with me 👍","diffHunk":"@@ -267,16 +268,17 @@ def get_file_dict(filename_list, log_printer=None, allow_raw_files=False):\n     :return:                Reads the content of each file into a dictionary\n                             with filenames as keys.\n     \"\"\"\n-    file_dict = {}\n+    file_set = {}","author":{"login":"Makman2","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6023916?v=4","name":"Mischa Krüger"},"createdAt":"2018-07-20T18:05:27Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-07-20T18:05:27Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDIwNDEyNjI3OA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5627#discussion_r204126278","bodyText":"Its to invoke FileFactory.string in case of raw files to raise a UnicodeDecode error so that we can move into the except clause that handles the raw files.

I would argue that https://github.com/wolever/parameterized is as good a solution which works well for all test frameworks.  We already have a complex set of pytest plugins, and already use testfixtures, so an additional test dependency isnt a new complexity problem.\nAnyway, my intention isnt to re-litigate that.

Emoji\n+make it much easier to give and receive feedback without a long comment thread.\n+Those emoji are called\n+`reactions <https://developer.github.com/v4/enum/reactioncontent/>`__ on GitHub\n+or `award emoji <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/award_emojis.html>`__ on GitLab.\n+They are used by people to publicly express their feelings about review\n+comments, which provides feedback to comment authors and all other members.\n+\n+There are 6 types of reactions on GitHub:\n+\n+============  =============  =======  =====\n+ Name         Markdown       Unicode  Emoji\n+============  =============  =======  =====\n+ THUMBS_UP    ``:+1:``       U+1F44D  👍\n+ THUMBS_DOWN  ``:-1:``       U+1F44E  👎\n+ LAUGH        ``:smile:``    U+1F604  😄\n+ HOORAY       ``:tada:``     U+1F389  🎉\n+ CONFUSED     ``:confused``  U+1F615  😕\n+ HEART        ``:heart:``    U+FE0F   ❤️\n+============  =============  =======  =====\n+\n+These reactions are reviews to reviews, thus we call them meta-reviews. To\n+encourage people to do meta-reviews, we build a meta-review system, which\n+collects reactions, analyze them, and use that information to improve our\n+review process and the quality of reviews. We give a score to people's\n+reviews based on reactions they receive. After scoring, a ranking list\n+is shown on coala community website.\n+\n+At the moment, only THUMBS_UP and THUMBS_DOWN are collected and analyzed,\n+as they are most commonly used and express strong and clear feelings:\n+THUMBS_UP means the review comment is well-written and helpful, while\n+THUMBS_DOWN means the review comment is misleading, or even worse, violates\n+`coala Community Code of Conduct <https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0006.md>`__.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    Only GitHub is being analyzed at the moment. Support for GitLab will\n+    be available in the future.\n+\n+Meta-review Process\n+-------------------\n+\n+The meta-review process for coala is as follows:\n+\n+1. Reviewers create their reviews.\n+\n+2. Anyone, especially author of the pull request, can do meta-review (THUMBS_UP,\n+   THUMBS_DOWN) via reactions on GitHub.\n+\n+3. Meta-review information will be collected and analyzed automatically:\n+\n+   * Meta-reviewers will be given bonus points to encourage such behaviour.\n+\n+   * Meta-reviewees will be given positive points (on receiving THUMBS_UP) or\n+     negative points (on receiving THUMBS_DOWN). Those points are weighted\n+     according to score of meta-reviewers. Those who have higher score in\n+     the meta-review system will have more impacts on others, so please do\n+     meta-reviews carefully.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    Due to limitations on GitHub, review summary\n+    (`example <https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2517#pullrequestreview-125039346>`__)\n+    is not able to be meta-reviewed. If your review is not related to any\n+    particular line, leaving a comment\n+    (`example <https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2517#issuecomment-393678689>`__)\n+    is encouraged.\n+\n+.. caution::\n+\n+    Don't **edit** or **delete** your review after it has been meta-reviewed.\n+    If you do that, you are destroying feedback from the community. This\n+    is considered as an improper behaviour and a negative score will be\n+    given to you.\n+\n+Automated Scoring Process\n+-------------------------\n+\n+A complete ranking list can be found on\n+`Meta-review score ranking list <https://deploy-preview-143--coala-community.netlify.com/meta-review/>`__.\n+Score is based on number of positive (THUMBS_UP) & negative (THUMBS_DOWN)\n+reactions one receives, and number of positive & negative reactions one gives\n+away. The formula can be found in\n+`cEP-0019.md <https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0019.md#ranking-list>`__.\n+Calculation details can be found in\n+`meta_review/handler.py <https://github.com/li-boxuan/community/blob/2143fbcf925beb1ffe5ab1d9dd4d177e827dece2/meta_review/handler.py>`__.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The scoring process is automated, and will be polished from time to\n+    time.
